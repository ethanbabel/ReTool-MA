# A Framework for LLM-based Multi-Agent Reinforced Training and Inference

</div>

MARTI is an open-source framework for training LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Reinforcement Learning (RL). It enables powerful, scalable, and adaptive workflows by combining centralized multi-agent interactions with distributed policy training. MARTI supports both built-in graph-based workflows and popular third-party multi-agent frameworks. We hope that MARTI not only advances reasoning capabilities beyond those of individual large language models or reasoning models, but also fosters collective intelligence as a step toward general artificial intelligence. 

**MARTI is still in a very early experimental stage, we are actively developing more powerful LLM-based multi-agent RL approaches and warmly welcome collaborations in this direction.**

## 🔍 Overview

Modern LLM applications often rely on complex task-solving strategies. While single-agent LLMs struggle with scalability and context tracking, multi-agent systems (MAS) offer a promising alternative. MARTI fills the gap between inference and training in MAS by introducing reinforcement learning for structured, collaborative agent behavior.

We designed the **MARTI** framework following the principle of centralized multi-agent interaction with distributed policy training, where all agent interactions and reward allocation occur centrally while policy training is distributed across individual agents. As illustrated in Figure 1, MARTI comprises three core modules: Multi-Agent World, Centralized Rewarding, and Single Agent Trainer.

<p align="center"><i>Figure 1: Overview of Core Components of MARTI</i></p>

Key Features:
- Multi-Agent Inference + RL Training in a unified framework
- Graph-based workflows (debate, chain-of-agents, mixture-of-agents)
- Support for heterogeneous models within the same agent graph
- Built-in credit assignment and reward shaping strategies
- Support for diverse RL algorithms ([PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347), [GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300), [REINFORCE++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03262v3), [TTRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16084))
- Third-party integration with AutoGen and CAMEL (experimental)
- Advanced performance on reasoning benchmarks (e.g., AIME)

Additionally, building on single-agent RL frameworks like [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF) and [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl), MARTI supports the vLLM v1 Engine and a Hybrid Engine to enable fast and efficient training.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/MARTI.git
cd MARTI

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Follow the setup instructions for dependencies, including OpenRLHF, Ray, and vLLM.

## ⚙️ Usage

### 🔁 Multi-Agent Inference

MARTI supports:
- Built-in DAG-based workflows: debate, mixture-of-agents, chain-of-agents
- Third-party frameworks: AutoGen and CAMEL (Experimental)

Example:

```bash
MODEL_DIR="Path to models, like Qwen2.5-3B"

# See the script for more inference examples
bash scripts/run_test_mas.sh ${MODEL_DIR}
```

### 🏋️ Multi-Agent Training

MARTI supports:
- Rule-based rewards (Reward Shaping)
- Generative reward models (LLM-as-Judge) (Experimental)
- Tree-based AgentPRM (ImplicitPRM) (Experimental)
- Supervised fine-tuning + RL (e.g., PPO, GRPO)

Example:

```bash
# Minimum hardware requirement for training with 3 Qwen2.5-3B agents: approximately 6×80G GPUs

MODEL_DIR="Path to models, like Qwen2.5-3B"
WANDB_KEY="API key of wandb"

# Train Single Agent with GRPO
bash scripts/run_train_grpo.sh ${MODEL_DIR} ${WANDB_KEY}

# Train Multi-Agent Debate with Reinforce++
bash scripts/run_train_mad.sh ${MODEL_DIR} ${WANDB_KEY}
```

### 🔥 Customised Async Step and Workflow

We introduce asynchronous tool use and workflow support for both single-agent and multi-agent RL pipelines. These features make our framework more modular, efficient, and scalable for a variety of RL scenarios.

**Single Agent Tool Use**
- Modular Steps (`marti/worlds/steps`): Each agent's actions are now organized in step files (e.g., `xxx_step.py`), making it easy to customize and extend for new tasks.
- Expanded Toolset (`marti/worlds/tools`): Our agents now have access to a broader range of tools for agentic decision-making, enabling richer interactions and problem-solving capabilities.

```bash
# Multi-turn Code RL
bash scripts/run_train_grpo_code.sh

# Multi-turn Search RL
bash scripts/run_train_grpo_search.sh
```

> Note: You can refer to [PeterGriffinJin/Search-R1](https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Search-R1) and [bytedance/SandboxFusion](https://github.com/bytedance/SandboxFusion) separately to set up search and code tool services.

**Multi-Agent Workflow**
- Workflow Orchestration (`marti/worlds/workflows`): We now support orchestrating complex multi-agent environments via modular workflow files (e.g., `xxx_workflow.py`). This allows coordinated interactions between multiple agents in a flexible and easily configurable manner.
- Advanced Processors (`marti/worlds/workflows`): Integrated processors (e.g., `xxx_processor.py`) support advanced reward shaping and custom feedback loops, empowering more sophisticated learning dynamics and agent cooperation/competition.

```bash
# Chain-of-agents (MathChat)
bash scripts/run_train_mathchat_async.sh

# Multi-agent Debate
bash scripts/run_train_mad_async.sh
```

These improvements open up new possibilities for research and deployment in both single-agent and multi-agent RL settings. As always, we're keen for your feedback and contributions!



### 📊 Preliminary Experiments

#### Training Details

We employ the MARTI framework to train both base and reasoning models, specifically `Qwen2.5-3B` and `DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview`. For `Qwen2.5-3B`, we implement DeepSeek-R1 zero-like reinforcement learning training using Level 3-5 samples from the MATH dataset. The `DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview` model, which exhibits strong inherent reasoning capabilities but presents training challenges, undergoes [Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL)](https://github.com/PRIME-RL/TTRL) adaptation on AIME benchmark data. For multi-agent reinforcement learning, we employ a cluster configuration consisting of 3 nodes, each equipped with 8 A800 80GB GPUs, allocating one full node per agent.

#### Benchmark Results
We compare non-reasoning and reasoning models under various configurations and show that majority voting consistently outperforms multi-agent workflows when trained conventionally. This reflects known limitations of current LLM-based agent systems, such as poor role adherence and ineffective inter-agent communication.

To address this, MARTI enhances model reasoning through structured agent interactions. As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, our experiments show that:

- MARTI-trained base models outperform standard RL setups and rival instructed models.
- Large reasoning models trained with MARTI using TTRL achieve state-of-the-art results on challenging tasks (e.g., 66.7 AIME score with Multi-Agent Debates).
- Multi-agent RL consistently surpasses single-agent systems in performance under the same compute budget.
