The projects will cover a broad spectrum of topics related to RL. Examples include new
theoretical methods for RL, applications of RL for LLMs, novel applications of RL in medical
domains, multi-objective RL, multi-agent RL, and other projects.
Groups of up to 3 students can participate in a single project. There are three possible ways to
implement a final project. Each student should choose the project by the end of the third week.
Each group will need to read one or more theoretical scientific papers published at a top
conference (ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, SIGCOMM, MICCAI, and so on) and execute the following
steps.
(20 points) Summarize the paper in a 5-6 page LaTeX document. The summary should include,
in your own words, the main idea, the related work, a clear explanation of the novelty, and key
steps of the new approaches.
(20 points) Present the paper and additional results in class. Aim for 15-minute presentations
and 5 minutes of questions, 20 minutes in total.
(10 points) Propose an improvement or new applications of the studied method. The
improvement should be understood very broadly (but non-trivially), e.g., improving a constant,
the number of passes over the data, better sample complexity, reducing the number of
iterations, and so on.
(10 points) Provide evidence of the proposed improvement of the new application. See the three
options below for possible ways to demonstrate the improvement.
1. Theory: Could you prove your proposed claims?
2. Heuristic path: Empirically demonstrate the improvement on some datasets.
3. Demonstrate that the proposed method gives a new application of sublinear methods.
